Through entries in the list, you can dynamize one keyword at a time and have it adjusted for AdWords visitors, depending on which ad they clicked on. To use the plugin, you first define a placeholder. You assign a default value (i.e. a word) to this placeholder, which is to be output if the visitor did not reach the page via AdWords. You then insert the placeholder on the landing page instead of the word that is to be replaced. In AdWords, you must add the parameter {_keyword} to the ad and enter the word that is to be output on the landing page as the value here.";
